Model Packs
-----------

- Varied quality - many are reasonable, but some are very low poly and some are poorly modelled.
- Preview images of the models are in each category folder
- Many have moving parts (wheels, rotors etc.) - check the Maya hierarchy (select Window->Outliner, then expand the plus signs)
